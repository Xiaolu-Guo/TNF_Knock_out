# TNF_Knock_out
Simulation for non-oscillation NFkB signal in TNF-/- in repsonse to TNF

Step 1. Download the whole folder to local.

Step 2. In matlab, run 'run_me.m' to get all the simulation and all the subfigures need to specify the data saving filefolder path and figure saving filefolder path. by default, it will create ./data ./figure under repo for saving data and figures.

Optional Step 3. One can set different values of the variables run_, draw_ to control which task should be done.

Optional Step 4. One can set different simulation size (10 cells is simulated by default) through changing the value of 'Num_sample'.

( ignore update.sh. this is for updating the codes in lib which comes from other projects)
